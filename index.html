	Zoos are certainly a very underrated or even in some cases, an overrated aspect of life considering that their entire premise is based around "showcasing" so called wild animals to the public in order to feed human curiosity. Undoubtedly so, human curiosity is what led to the creation of such a thing, what makes a zoo extremely interesting is seeing a wide array of animals that one mostly only hears about or reads about at some point making seeing them outside their habitat, along with their overall stature and look extremely interesting.

	At some point, it is crucial to visit a zoo just to see how these animals are living along with seeing how there is so much more to the world and be amazed at the fact that a fraction of it can be contained (although ethical views argue against the concept of zoos).

	Visitng a zoo is also a fun way of getting into animal photography considering that it let's one interact with animals without getting extremely dangerous like it possibly could in the wild. It could also inspire people to get into animal protection, or get into animal photography, or possibly into preservation of endangered species, and maybe in general, get people more affectionate towards animals and their position in the world.

	Zoos are without a doubt one of the most interesting ways to learn about how animals behave and interact with their surrounding environment along with how these animals have adapted to their surroundings that supposedly resembles their habitat but is in some way different from what they might experience in the wild. Visiting a local zoo is also a good way to support them while also getting to learn about animals and possibly even taking pictures of them!
