# 🦁 Zoos to Be Seen

**Zoos to Be Seen** is a multi-page educational and advocacy website designed to showcase the value of zoos in fostering awareness, curiosity, and conservation. Built using HTML and CSS, the site features visually engaging layouts, linked resources, interactive content, and a themed credit card application form.

This project was built to highlight my frontend web development skills, particularly in layout structuring, visual design, and semantic HTML.
