	Despite sharing a common name, red pandas are not closely related to giant pandas—often considered the real panda. Phylogenetically, the red panda falls under a unique taxonomic group called Ailuridae, sharing common traits with mustelids, which includes racoons, weasels and skunks. Giant pandas are classified under a separate, distant taxonomic family of bears called Ursidae.

	Black rhinos are currently listed as critically endangered species, and only 3 subspecies now exist:

		<br>
	1. Eastern black rhino Diceros bicornis michaeli 
		<br>
	2. Southern Central black rhino Diceros bicornis minor
		<br>
	3. South Western black rhino Diceros bicornis bicornis
	Rhino poaching is still one of the biggest threats to the Black rhinoceros, as well as to other African rhinos. The western black rhino, a subspecies, was declared extinct in 2011 as a direct consequence of poaching and the illegal wildlife trade.

	Cheetahs are blisteringly fast and can reach speeds up to 64 miles per hour in 3 seconds, making them the fastest land animals in the world over short distances. For comparison with humans, Usain Bolt currently holds the record as the fastest man in the world, with a top speed of around 27 miles per hour. A cheetah can outpace the world's fastest man by more than twice his speed, whether in the wild or on a race track!

	Sloths are primarily folivores, feeding mostly on leaves, fruits and sap of various trees. They have a large and efficient multi-chambered stomach that helps with digesting tough, fibrous leaves. The sloth’s digestion rate is linked to its low metabolism, and more leaves can only be ingested once there is enough room in the stomach—this is often full accounting as much as 37% of its body mass. Therefore, sloths eat very little food per day since digestion takes a very long time to complete, sometimes even days or weeks.
